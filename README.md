# Project 1 - Exploring Weather Trends

<b>Summary

In this project, We will analyze local and global temperature data and compare the temperature trends where you live to overall global temperature trends.

<b>Goal of the Project

Our goal will be to create a visualization and prepare a write up describing the similarities and differences between global temperature trends and temperature trends in the closest big city to where you live.

<b>Technologies Used

1.SQL<br>
2.Excel<br>

<b>Statistical Analysis

1.Moving Average<br>

2.Correlation,Including P-Value calculations and variance discussion.<br>

3.T-tests<br>

4.Linear Regression and prediction with confidence Intervals <br>
    
    


<b>Observations

1.Global temperatures have seen a sharp increase since 1980 compared to the previous 200 years<br>

2.In the 19th Century we can observe both temperatures were closed, which is a neutral point.<br>

3.In the overall report, we can see that from the past 2-century temperature is dropping or increasing within 1.5 C.<br>

4.Global temperatures strongly correlate with, and can be used the predict (with 95% confidence intervals) changes in, city temperatures<br>
